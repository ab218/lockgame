## Summary

A variation of the numerical logic game [Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows).

To set up the game, first choose the game mode and the number (_n_) of digits for the secret combination. When playing alone or with others, the answer should be hidden from the players who are attempting to solve the secret combination.

Each guess should be an _n_ digit number. The feedback received after each guess corresponds with numbers that appear in the secret combination. A "click" indicates that it is a matching digit in the correct position and a "clack" indicates that it is in a different position.

The objective of this game is to deduce the correct combination of numbers in as few guesses as possible.
